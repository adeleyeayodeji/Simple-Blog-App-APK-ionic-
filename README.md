Building a Simple REST API for Mobile Applications [With Source Code]

Have you ever wanted to develop a mobile application for a website?

If Yes, you are at the right Post.

What is REST?
Representational State Transfer (REST) is lightweight, HTTP based and runs on web servers much like ‘normal’ web sites.

Instead of delivering in HTML, which is a combination of presentation and data, data is displayed with minimum formatting using separators and delimiters (like JSON).
